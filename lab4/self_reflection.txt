All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: Just found out that the number of line of my code was fewer than other people’s project. Not a lot different but still I am proud of it because I worked on simplifying my code. 

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: 

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I will start this.first and this.last from somewhere not 0th. I am not entirely sure how it benefit but it might makes some methods simpler.
